# HR-attrition---Excel-Dashboard
This project is all about analysis of data for employee attrition in an organisation and the analysis is from the prospective of the HR department of the organisation.


This project focuses on HR analysis of employee attrition and factors related to it. In this dashboard, I have included KPI's like total employee count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, and average age.

Findings:
There are a total of 1470 employees in the firm.
237 number of employees have left the company.
Rate of Attrition: 16.1%, which is low.
Average Age: 37 years old.

99 of the 273 employees who left had only a bachelor's degree, and 50â€“60% were sales executives or laboratory technicians. When we look at attrition by department, the majority of the employees were from the human resources department.

This dashboard is an example of how data visualization can help the HR department make informed decisions. It's user-friendly, interactive, and provides a variety of charts and graphs that help users gain a deeper understanding of the data.

One of the most impressive features of this dashboard is its ability to filter data. Users can filter the data by education, allowing them to focus on the areas that matter most to them. This feature enables users to gain a better understanding of the data and make informed decisions based on the insights provided.
